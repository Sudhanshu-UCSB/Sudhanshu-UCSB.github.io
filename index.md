## About me

I am Sudhanshu Srivastava, a third year PhD student in the [Dynamical Neuroscience program](https://www.dyns.ucsb.edu/) at UCSB. I work in the [Vision and Image Understanding Lab](https://viu.psych.ucsb.edu/) with [Prof Miguel Eckstein](https://viu.psych.ucsb.edu/people/miguel-eckstein). Prior to this, I obtained an MS in Computer Science at the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/) and an integrated BS-MS in Mathematics at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal](https://www.iiserb.ac.in/). 

I work at the intersection of human vision and computer vision, using tools such as visual psychophysics with eye tracking, deep neural networks and Bayesian ideal observers.
